        Hi, I'm <b>Hesam</b> — a Frontend Developer with a Passion for Crafting
        Exceptional User Experiences. With years of experience in creating
        dynamic, responsive, and accessible web applications, I specialize in
        Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and modern frontend technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm proud to contribute to Mercedes-Benz, where I develop
        cutting-edge solutions that merge design, functionality, and
        performance. My approach to development is grounded in collaboration,
        attention to detail, and a relentless drive for innovation. I'm always
        exploring new ways to improve workflows, enhance SEO, and elevate
        accessibility standards to create meaningful digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring video games, bike riding,
        or perfecting my coffee-making skills. Feel free to explore my portfolio
        and reach out — I'd love to connect and discuss how I can bring value to
        your next project.
